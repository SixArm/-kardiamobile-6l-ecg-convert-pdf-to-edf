# KardiaMobile 6L ECG: convert PDF into EDF

KardioMobile 6L is an electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG) device by AliveCor that records heart signals.

The device and app have a default export to Portable Document Format (PDF) but not to European Data Format (EDF).

This repository provides:

1. A python tool to convert a KardioMobile 6L electrocardiogram export from PDF into EDF.

2. Example data file in PDF and EDF. This is my real patient health information. I'm sharing it with the public for research purposes.

Notes:

- Use this script at your own risk.

- The python tool is generated by Claude Code AI.

- I've reviewed the code and it looks reasonable to me.

- Constructive feedback welcome.
